                    The range you pick will have a tradeoff between how likely it is that the “true” value actually lies within the range you choose vs. having a narrow enough range that your measurement is actually useful. A very large range is more likely to include the "true" value, but may be so nonspecific that it is not useful. A narrow range has more specificity but may not include the "true" value.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Different people will feel more or less comfortable with the different sides of this tradeoff, and there isn’t really a right or wrong answer as long as you justify why you
                    chose what you did.

                    The way scientists think about their reported range of a measurement is to imagine the likelihood that the “true” value lies within the specified range. For example, you might give a narrower range of possible values, where you believe the true value has a 2 in 3 chance of being within the specified range. Or you might give a wider range of possible values, where you believe the true value has a 19 in 20 chance of being within the specified range.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You can do this by counting how many of your classmates’ measurements fall within the range you selected vs how many measurements were made all together within your class.
