        Let’s assume for a moment that there is no systematic uncertainty (or bias) in our measurements. That would mean that the true value for the age of the universe should lie within the range of measured values, most likely at the middle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now let's imagine randomly selecting one student's measured age value from all the student measurements and one class's measured age value from all the class measurements.
