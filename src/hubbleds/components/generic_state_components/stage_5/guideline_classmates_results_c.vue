        Now let’s look at age estimates of the universe from other classes who have already completed this data story.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let’s look at the data, class by class. Some class measured the lowest age value for the universe. Some class measured the highest age.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use the slider to scan through the age estimates that each participating class measured.
