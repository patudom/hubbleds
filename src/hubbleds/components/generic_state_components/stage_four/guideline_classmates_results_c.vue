        Now let’s look at age estimates of the universe from other classes who have already completed this data story.

          Full disclosure for our pilot testers: Since there were not many students before you, the CosmicDS team acted as "seed students," created galaxies measurements as you have, and grouped our data into "classes."

      </v-card>
      <p>
        Let’s look at the data, class by class. Some class measured the lowest age value for the universe. Some class measured the highest age.

        Use the slider to scan through the age estimates that each participating class measured.
